# Genomics-align3r

A simple example script for aligning Illumina reads to a reference with bwa and calling snps and indels with samtools.
The main goal is to show the utility of positional arguments in bash scripts. 

Dependencies
------------

+ bwa (mem)
+ samtools
+ bcftools


Inputs
------

+ a reference genome in good old fasta format, be sure line lengths are normalized
+ a fastq file with single end reads

Usage
-----

To execute script, while on the command line, type:
```bash
bash align3r.sh <reference.fa> <reads.fastq> 
```
